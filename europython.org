* TODO add links to all the interesting talks

* Bilbao

The conference was organised for the second year in Bilbao, in the Basque country in north of Spain.

Bilbao has been an industrial and quite polluted city for a long time.
In more recent years however the decline of the heavy industries (which reduced pollution) and some famous architects gave a great push to Bilbao.

The food (meat and fish specially) is also great, and definitively make it a very interesting place to visit.
Near the old city there is also a nice funicolar (which had its 100th anniversary recently) that brings you up.

* Conference venue

The venue was in a great modern building next to the river.
Kudos to the organisers for the great work in preparing it as well.

* Interesting talks

Lots of interesting topics and too many to mention in a single blog post, but for some honourable mentions:

# add links for the various talks here

** Larry Hasting and the *gilectomy*

The infamous GIL has been a reason of debate for a very long time now, and many have asked for its removal.

Larry Hastings (one of Python core developers) gave a very good talk about a project he's been working on for the last few months.
Apparently removing the GIL is not that hard and Larry already did it in an experimental branch, however the performances are terrible, even when adding multiple cores.

The reasons are mainly related with data locality, how CPU caches work and the reference counting garbage collector currently used by Python.
He then discussed some possible solutions that can be used to mitigate these issues, and dived more deeply into the problems associated with them.

** Asyncio

Asyncio 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html
is a "toolkit" initially created by 

** Pytest nodev

Another very interesting idea is pytest-nodev (https://github.com/nodev-io/pytest-nodev).

This little project allows you to find code that solves your problem in your environment, specifying just the behaviour you need.
It works by simply trying to call everything it finds and see if it behaves as desired.

And it does not just call functions but instantiate classes, looking up in methods/properties and attributes.
Because this tool just calls arbitrary code it's very important to not run it on your local environment, and the author was demoing it running it in a docker container without root access.

The great thing about this project is that it has great potential to help detecting logic duplication, and there are plans for an actual online index that allows to search.

** Coala

Coala (https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala) is a very interesting framework that aims to make code analysis easier for all languages.
Two things in particular I find interesting about this project:

- it tries to re-use all existing technology, using /bears/ to interface with existing tools
- it doesn't just report on style violations but can also act on them fixing the code

** Jupyter

Jupyter is the project that was known as IPython notebook, and it doesn't stop impressing me for how great it is.

Visualisation of complex data has always fascinated me, and maybe the best thing I've seen about that at europython was a talk that combined jupyter, bokeh and networkx.

In just a few lines of code the speaker managed to create an interactive network using data from twitter users that tweeted about europython.
This graph was interactive as you could explore, zoom in and even remove nodes.
For example the @europython account was obviously always in the middle

https://networkx.github.io/

** Arguman

Very interesting platform that was shown during a lightning talk

This is an example of one of the most discussed topics by developers:

** Reverse debugger

Armin Rigo (one of Pypy authors) gave a great little demo about reverse debugging in Python.
https://morepypy.blogspot.ie/2016/07/reverse-debugging-for-python.html

It was quite impressive to see how you can go back in time and set complex watch expressions.

** LIGO and the gravitational waves discovery

In February there was a great Physics discovery done by one of the physics institute, you can read more here: https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211

I'm not brave enough to try to explain the Physics behind all this, but the discovery was apparently groundbreaking and the coronation of a dream for many.
The impressive thing about this project is that almost everything in the chain of tools needed during this project has been written in Python and released as open source straight away.

A great and inspiring way to do science and overall a very interesting project.

** Python at Disney studios

Disney also had one of the keynotes, and similarly to the LIGO keynote, they also have an impressive use of Python in their technology stack.

** Prompt tookit



** Prometheus

I heard something about this project before but didn't really know much about it.

* Social events

Europython organisers did a very good job keeping everyone busy day and night, organising various events.

The europython mobile app was also a great way to communicate with all the attendees, and they even created a channel on Telegram (a Whatsapp alternative).

The second day I was one of the 50 lucky attendees who managed to get a ticket for the kayaking event.
Since the venue is just along the river there was a rental place for kayaks just 5 minutes away.

It was one of the hottest day of the year for Bilbao and thankfully we left around 20, when the sun started going down.
# add something more about this event

I also attended the social event organised the third night of the event, in a very nice venue that looked like a theatre.

The Italian community (with some of the past and probably future europython organisers) was also quite strong in Bilbao this year, one night we managed to get 30 Italians in the same restaurant.

* Python evolution

There is an ever growing interest in big data and data science, with topics like machine learning and neural networks creating more and more interest.
It was also nice to see that the scientific community overall not only embraced Python as their language of choice, but also is the /avant guarde/ for Python3 adoption, as this official statement about it claims:

https://python3statement.github.io/

Another big thing (as the schedule can argument) is asyncio and all the ecosystem around it.
# TODO: this is already written also above, try to merge
Asyncio is not a framework but more of a toolkit for asynchronous code, and even projects like Twisted can potentially rebuild on top of that.

* Conclusion

Overall the conference was a great success, and I would encourage everyone to attend.

The only "complaint" might be that not all talks were well prepared or well presented, which is a shame since sometimes the topics would have been really interesting.

The level was also mostly superficial (apart from a few )
